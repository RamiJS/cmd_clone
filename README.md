# Cmd Clone

## Description

This project is a clone of the command line interface (CLI) found on a Mac computer. It allows users to enter specific commands to display information about the creator. The project also features a drag and drop functionality and typewriter effect, which makes it look like a real Mac CLI.

The goal of this project was to create a personal portfolio that showcases my skills in web development. By creating this project, I was able to demonstrate my ability to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces that mimic real-world applications.

## Features
- Command Line Interface: Users can enter specific commands to display information about the creator.
- Drag and Drop Functionality: Users can click and drag the window to move it around the screen.
- Typewriter Effect: Text appears on the screen as if it is being typed in real-time.
